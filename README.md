# wayland-clipboard-listener

I would rather to use animate girl to name the crate, but it will cannot show how the crate do

it impl `wlr-data-control-unstable-v1`, you can see the protocol under

[wlr-data-control-unstable-v1](https://wayland.app/protocols/wlr-data-control-unstable-v1)

you can use it on sway or kde

it is GPL-v3, if you use the code, you need to privide your code, you should not fuck to use the code to listen on people's clipboard and upload it to you company or government, you must fuck to opensource your code.
